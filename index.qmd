I’m an environmental data scientist with a focus on data visualization and science communication. I’m currently completing a Master’s in Environmental Data Science at UC Santa Barbara, where my work combines spatial analysis, data visualization, and applied environmental research. With a background in marine biology spanning fieldwork, environmental education, and data-driven analysis, I enjoy building tools and stories that make environmental data accessible and meaningful to diverse audiences.
