Iâ€™m a marine biologist with a passion for ocean life, data visualization, and science communication. I studied Marine Biology at UC Santa Cruz and have worked in environmental education, field research, and data analysis. I enjoy finding creative ways to connect people with the natural world and make environmental data more engaging and accessible.
