I grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, in proximity to the ocean, mountains, and bay. Growing up in nature led me to pursue a career in Marine Biology. At UC Santa Cruz I participated in numerous research projects including a study on Posedonia Oceanica in Corsica, France. This research project was analyzed and visualized in JMP, which made me think: there must be a better way. 

After that project I began to teach myself R, along with taking a graduate course on analysis and visualization using the program. This course made me realize a passion for visualization as a means for scientific communication. 

Post graduation I went back to the San Francisco Bay to work at the Marine Science Institute, an environmental education institution in Redwood City. At the institute I taught K-college level students about the ecology and dynamics of the bay, often from our 90 foot research vessel. This position taught me alot about how to communicate scientific ideas to different groups and age ranges. This position made me yearn for more opportunities to communicate and study ecology and marine environments, which led to me to finding my current program at UCSB. 

The Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program has really taught me alot, despite me only being in the second quarter. I have expanded my horizons on python, geospatial data, and more rigorous statistical analyses. In the winter quarter I will be starting my capstone which examines Bird population dynamics in different GAP statuses. More to come on that soon!

When i'm not working on assignments i've been enjoying playing soccer, crocheting, and going for sunrise cold plunges in the Pacific ocean (I still don't know the difference between Sands and Devereux)
